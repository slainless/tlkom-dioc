# DIOC

My oldest project was made during my internship at `ＴＥＬＫＯＭ` in 2016. Uploaded to source control for archivement and persistance purpose.

Pretty hellish project since I was very inexperienced at the time and did't even know that version control exist. Adding PHP to the mix (and a pure PHP at that) made the project even more chaotic.

## About

A full-stack dashboard that handles customer complaints. It's nothing but a complex project since the size of the data being handled is considerable, considering that I was working in a regional office at the provincial level. Aside from typical CRUD operations, there are also other features such as scheduled tasks using CRON, user and session management, statistics, and aggregation.

## Stack

Probably using atleast PHP version 7. 

UI built in traditional way, using HTML and CSS. UI made using `UIKit` v1 or v2 (idk, cant remember). And surprise, it's even almost fully-responsive.

Mainly using JQuery to manipulate DOM and adding interactivity.

## State

Since it's such an old project, i doubt this thing can even be ran properly even when i have the database ready.
